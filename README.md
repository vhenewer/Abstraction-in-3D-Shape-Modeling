# Abstraction in 3D Shape Modeling

## Assignment Overview
This assignment demonstrates the concept of abstraction and polymorphism in Python using an abstract base class for 3D shapes.

It includes:
- An abstract class `Shape3D`.
- Subclasses: `Sphere`, `Cylinder`, and `Cube`.
- Random generation of 3D shapes.
- Calculation and display of surface area and volume.

## Structure
- `shapes.py`: Contains all class definitions.
- `main.py`: Generates random shapes and displays their properties.
- `screenshots/`: Contains screenshots of outputs.
